There was once a little boy named Mark. He liked to play tennis. The only problem is that he was really bad.  Mark wanted to get better at tennis so he practiced everyday.  Even after weeks of practicing, Mark still wasn't good at tennis and he didn't know what to do. One day Mark woke up and tried playing one more time. Suddenly he was very good at tennis!
